            <h2>What is Being a Chaplain?</h2>
            <p>
                A **Chaplain** is a minister or faith leader who provides spiritual care outside the walls of a church. They serve in diverse settings like hospitals, schools, military units, prisons, and corporations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The role of a Chaplain is to offer **non-judgmental spiritual support, emotional comfort, and guidance** to people of all faiths (or no faith) during times of crisis, change, or spiritual need. They are a presence of peace, compassion, and hope, dedicated to the holistic well-being of individuals in secular or specialized environments.
